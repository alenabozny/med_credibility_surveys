            Credibility of the medical web content Dataset consists of over 10,000 sentences tagged by human experts (medical professionals).

            Articles collected manually from various e-health websites were divided into individual sentences. Each sentence was tagged by an expert with the following set of labels:
            <ul>
                <li style="color: #2ca02c">CRED (credible) - is reliable, does not raise major objections, contains verifiable information from the medical domain;</li>
                <li style="color: #ff7f0e">NONCRED (not credible) - contains false or unverifiable information; contains persuasion contrary to current medical recommendations; contains outdated information;</li>
                <li style="color: #1f77b4">NEU (neutral) - does not contain information (eg. is a question); is not related to medicine;</li>
            </ul>

            The full dataset consists of some additional data:
            <ul>
                <li>(time_start/time_end) Time of the assessment</li>
                <li>(steps) Width of the context window that was needed for the expert to assess one sentence (integer varying from 0 to 7, when 0 means that no additional context was needed, and 7 meant that 7 preceding and 7 following sentences from the original text were needed)</li>
<!--                 <li>Expert's reason for selecting the NONCRED label</li>
 -->            </ul>
