{"title": "Antioxidants", "body": "‘Antioxidant’ is a buzzword we’ve heard time and again in recent years. These compounds are known to combat free radicals and alleviate oxidative stress in the body. Thankfully, we produce antioxidants from the nutrients obtained in food – selenium for instance, and from antioxidants directly, like vitamin C. However, our diets can often contain low levels of these nutritional powerhouses, so taking a supplement is a simple and effective way to support the body. Recently, much scientific attention has turned to certain plant cells called ‘polyphenols’ and ‘flavonoids’, which are said to form a key component of our dietary antioxidant intake. At Nature’s Best®, we like to remain in vogue with our supplements, so you’ll notice that much of our antioxidant range contains these plant powerhouses. We also insist that all our products are UK-made, high-strength and premium quality – you won’t be disappointed.
