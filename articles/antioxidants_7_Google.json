It is for this reason we test out the product for you. This testing phase also helps us see different effects of the product, their product claims like gluten free, vegan friendly, or even potent formula. If a product is making claims, we test it out and see if it stands by it. Secondly, not all people react to products the same way. Different people may see various effects to the same medication or supplement. It is for this reason that we do thorough research into user reviews and ratings. These reviews give us an indication of how a larger pool of people reacted to a particular product. Then with the help of statistical trends, we are able to deduce how well the general population will perceive a particular product. This significant reason is why the user review and ratings step is very crucial in the product recommendation phase.
