"body":"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, including conditions such as attention deficit disorder, generalized disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Asperger syndrome. This is due to the fact that children with autism are observed to malfunction in every area of ​​development. The first symptoms of this disease appear in infants several months old. Each child's autistic disorder varies widely. Making a diagnosis conditions the occurrence of irregularities: in social relations, in communication, and in fun. Genetics is the main cause of autism. The upward trend in this disease shows, however, that not only genes are the culprit. Epidemiological data are clear - the number of people with autism is increasing. About 30 years ago in the US, autistic disorders occurred in one child in 2,000. children, in 1995 every 500th child was ill, currently almost every 100th child is born with autistic disorder. In our country, no thorough epidemiological studies have been conducted regarding this disease. However, specialists estimate that about 30,000 people (including 10,000 children) have autism. The number of patients is huge, which raises a problem that must be tackled as soon as possible. Only genes cannot cause such a rapid upward trend. The cause of the disease is also the surrounding environment. Studies show some correlations. Because some neurological disorders are related to diet and digestive system functioning. Incorrect digestion of gluten and casein in the intestines and an increase in the absorption into the bloodstream of incompletely hydrolyzed peptides disrupts the development of the central nervous system and destroys its functions in children with autism. Patients also have a reduced activity of lactase - an enzyme that breaks down lactose (milk sugar). It has also been observed that people with autism have altered intestinal microflora. The beneficial microflora destroyed by harmful bacteria may cause the development of Candida albicans - this phenomenon may indirectly increase the intestinal barrier permeability. The proper functioning of the intestine determines immunity. Imbalance of the intestinal bacterial flora and change in the permeability of the intestinal barrier reduces immunity, and thus is associated with continuous inflammation. This in turn intensifies the symptoms of autism. The mushroom needs sugar as food to grow and grow. Sugar, lactose, casein and gluten are therefore components that must be eliminated from the diet in children with autism. Nutrition excluding these nutrients alleviates digestive, metabolic and mental symptoms in patients. Gluten-free diet is based on avoiding gluten in the diet, i.e. products based on wheat, oats, rye and barley. Gluten-free foods that can replace these products are rice, corn, millet and wheat starch. Currently, the food industry offers us a large range of ready-made gluten-free products such as bread, pasta, porridges, mixtures of various types of flour from which you can prepare attractive dishes for your child. The international symbol \"crossed-out ear\" or the inscription \"gluten-free product\" makes it easier to find such products. A dairy-free diet eliminates casein and lactose. All dairy products such as whey, buttermilk, sour milk, powdered milk, yogurt, kefir, cream and cheese (processed, hard, cottage cheese) should be excluded. In addition, attention should be paid to hidden sources of milk, which can be: dumplings, whitened soups, puddings, sauces, margarines. Soy protein has a similar structure to casein, therefore soy products should also not be on the menu. In this case, the nutrition of infants and young children can certainly be used: milk replacers: hydrolysates of cow's milk protein with a high degree of hydrolysis, elemental mixtures, as well as meat homogenates. A sugar-free diet excludes the supply of sugars to the body. You should give up cakes, sweets, cheese, fruit yoghurt etc. You can give up an alternative to sugar, e.g. xylitol, which is a natural sweetener made of birch bark. It is processed differently than sugar in the body and does not ferment in the intestines. In addition, it has antibacterial and antifungal properties. Stevia, where powdered leaves of this plant are used for sweetening, can be a sugar substitute. Autistic children should be under the constant care of a dietitian, who will include their appropriate nutrition program. A nutritionist can accurately present which products should be excluded and what to eat so that the child's diet is fully balanced and provides the necessary ingredients for proper growth and development. In Poland, the awareness of treating autism by diet is low. The so-called basic and complementary methods. The first of them consist mainly in teaching the child proper behavior, matching tasks to the patient's abilities and social contacts. Also complementary methods based mainly on classes with a speech therapist and animals. By including dietary care, it would be possible to ensure that the child's symptoms are silenced and hence normal functioning. ",
