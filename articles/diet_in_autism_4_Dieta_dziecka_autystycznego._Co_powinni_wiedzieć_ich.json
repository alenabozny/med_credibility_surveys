Co powinni wiedzieÄ‡ ich rodzice? - BabyBoom", "body": "Parents of autistic children are constantly looking for new methods, nutrition and therapy to alleviate their child's difficulties. One such way is a special diet. The diet in autism often involves eliminating milk, gluten and sugar. However, be careful. Special diet for an autistic child. Why do parents think it's worth it? Meals consist of complex substances: proteins, fats, carbohydrates. In order for the body to absorb them, it must digest them - break down into simple substances. Only then can he use them. The process of this \"breaking up\" is complicated and requires the production of many special substances - enzymes. Proponents of treating autism with a diet claim that children on the autism spectrum are deficient in these enzymes. Their lack means that proteins are not broken down into amino acids, and the body tries to assimilate them in such a form that is inappropriate and harmful to the body. If the child has a problem with the intestines - and apparently it is quite common among young children whose digestive system is not mature enough; the intestines are also easily \"damaged\" by giving the child e.g. antibiotics, the problem is increasing. The worst are proteins derived from casein (milk protein) and gluten (protein present in many cereals). Their structure is similar to that of opoids such as morphine. Therefore, children seem to be addicted to eating certain dishes, and their behavior deviates from the norm. The elimination of sugars, in turn, results from the observation of parents who believe that the child after eating sugars is over-stimulated. What does scientific research say? What should parents of autistic children pay attention to? Researchers from the Marcus Autism Center at the Emory University School of Medicine analyzed all published studies on eating problems among children with autism spectrum (ASD). They found that children with ASD are five times more likely to have meal problems, including they are accompanied by extreme nutritional restrictions, selectivity and severe tantrums. They also found that children with autism are much more malnourished compared to children who are not affected by the disorder. Particularly, calcium deficiency has been found, which is responsible for bones and proteins, necessary for proper growth, mental development or health. Researchers believe that diet depletion carries the risk of social difficulties and poor educational achievement. And although parents report that after eliminating casein and gluten from the child's condition, they emphasize that they should not make such decisions without consulting a doctor. It is best to introduce nutritional changes in consultation with a dietitian who will help you arrange an optimal balanced meal plan. In the past, many doctors have ridiculed the idea that diet, food additives, sugar, etc. can affect children's behavior. They believed that there was not enough scientific evidence for this. In 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics admitted that it could have made a mistake, accepted and changed its approach. What do parents usually eliminate from the diet of autistic children?

The diet can be introduced gradually, first excluding milk, then gradually gluten, so that the child slowly gets used to the changes. The child may be initially nervous, restless and displaying hunger symptoms, like a drug addict. Diet? Yes, but under certain conditions ... It is important to be aware of what ingredients are necessary for health and replace them with others (e.g. calcium) when deciding on such a restrictive diet. Therefore, the diet should be carried out under the supervision of a specialist - preferably a doctor. It is worth examining the child in advance and check if he / she is allergic to milk / gluten, is not suffering from food intolerance (e.g. lactose) and whether there is celiac disease. If your child has calf, diet is the decision to eliminate gluten for life. If there is none, then after some time you can gradually return to the consumption of small amounts of gluten. Careful observation of the child is also very important. Such a diet can also be monotonous, troublesome and too poor, so you need to be ready for various culinary challenges, so that food does not become a torment for the child. Making decisions about such far-reaching changes under the influence of an article or opinion of a mother's friend is not a good idea - such a decision should be carefully thought over and consulted. You know your child and you know your own abilities. Plan your strategy before making changes. For many children, small changes are more acceptable than a sudden change of everything. You can start by replacing processed foods with fresh fruit or vegetables, for example. Avoid artificial colors and flavors. Try recreating your child's favorite food - then gradually change the recipe for healthier ingredients. www.autism.org", "pub_date": "2013-08-13T00:00:00", "access_date": "2019-11-25", "query": "diet autism", "Google rank": "", "url": "https://www.babyboom.pl/maluszek/zdrowie/dieta-dziecka-autystycznego", "keywords": "dish, tasty, acceptable, nice, child"}
