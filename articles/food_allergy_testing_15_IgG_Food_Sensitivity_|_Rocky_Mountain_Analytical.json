{"title": "IgG Food Sensitivity | Rocky Mountain Analytical", "body": "In an IgG reaction, the IgG antibodies attach themselves to the food antigen and create an antibody-antigen complex. These complexes are normally removed by special cells called macrophages.  However, if they are present in large numbers and the reactive food is still being consumed, the macrophages can’t remove them quickly enough.  The food antigen-antibody complexes accumulate and are deposited in body tissues. Once in tissue, these complexes release inflammation causing chemicals, which may play a role in numerous diseases and conditions. \n\tWhy Test IgG Food Sensitivity? There is a growing body of evidence to support the clinical benefits of eliminating IgG reactive foods from the diet. IgG food sensitivities have been implicated in migraine headaches and irritable bowel syndrome (alternating diarrhea and constipation).  Bloating and indigestion are also common food sensitivity reactions, as is fatigue.  Continued consumption of reactive foods may contribute to weight gain and/or difficulty losing weight.  Eczema is also commonly associated with food reactions. Because IgG food reactions take hours or days to develop, this makes it difficult to determine which food is responsible for the reaction without doing testing.
