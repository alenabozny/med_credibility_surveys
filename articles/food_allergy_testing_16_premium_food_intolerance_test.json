A food intolerance is difficulty digesting certain foods and having an unpleasant physical reaction to them. As individuals, our reactions to foods and drinks vary a great deal. An ingredient which may cause problems for one person could be completely acceptable for another. The most common food intolerance symptoms are bloating and stomach pains, which usually come on a few hours after consuming the food. How to find out if you are intolerant to foods? At YorkTest, we like to refer to this as our personal ‘food fingerprint’.

It’s common to believe that a food allergy and a food intolerance are the same thing, but they take on different processes in the body. food allergy vs food intolerance yorktestA food allergy can cause a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. This is when released chemicals act on the blood vessels to cause swelling. Food allergies normally appear instantly and up to two hours after consumption. A food intolerance, on the other hand, may take up to three days to show any symptoms, making it problematic to identify the cause. A food intolerance is not life-threatening but can cause distressing symptoms, such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), migraines and headaches, skin issues, tiredness and joint pain. Suspect you may have a food allergy instead of a food intolerance? Not to worry.  You can find our food allergy test here. For more information on the difference between a food allergy and a food intolerance, click here. This test will analyse your IgG antibody reactions to 208 food and drink ingredients. There are four different types of food-specific IgG antibodies. Unlike many of our competitors, we test the levels of all four of these to pinpoint the ingredients your body is reacting to.
