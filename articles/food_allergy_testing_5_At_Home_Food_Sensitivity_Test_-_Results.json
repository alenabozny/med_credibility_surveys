{"title": "At Home Food Sensitivity Test - Results You Can Understand - EverlyWell", "body": "Your body can react to a troublesome food in several different ways, and how your body reacts to that food depends on whether you have a food sensitivity, food intolerance, or food allergy. It's not uncommon for confusion to exist around the fact that allergies, intolerances, and sensitivities aren't interchangeable. Here, well explore each of these types of reaction to food starting with food sensitivity. A food sensitivity may result from a type of immune system response thats very different than a food allergy. While not entirely understood, research has shown that people may identify symptom-causing foods using the results of IgG testing along with an elimination diet. IgG antibody reactions against those foods may be normal in some people, but in others it may cause symptoms because of the inflammation the immune reaction produces from those interactions. Food sensitivity symptoms reported by our customers include acne, brain fog, dry and itchy skin and more. What's really interesting about food sensitivities is that symptoms usually don't appear as soon as you eat the problem food. Instead, you might have symptoms hours or days after eating that food which can make it hard to connect specific foods to the symptoms you're experiencing. Fortunately, with an elimination diet and EverlyWell's Food Sensitivity Test, you can discover what foods you may be sensitive to.

Those antibody-food interactions result in the production of a chemical called histamine. Histamine is a type of substance your immune system makes. When immune cells release histamine in your body, you might experience any number of allergy symptoms. (That's why many over-the-counter allergy medications are known as antihistamines they counteract the allergic effects of histamine.) With food allergies, symptoms usually appear almost as soon as you've eaten the trigger food. An example of a food allergy is an allergy to tree nuts, one of the most common causes of food-related allergic reactions in the world. (Hazelnuts, walnuts, and macadamia nuts are all examples of tree nuts.) If you're allergic to a certain food, you can experience a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction whenever you eat that food. That's because anaphylaxis can occur within minutes of consuming food allergens. Anaphylaxis can result in death because of a dramatic drop in blood pressure or because of swelling around the person's airways, which cuts off the body's supply of air. A food intolerance can occur if, for example, you don't have enough of the right enzymes your body needs to break down a particular food. (Enzymes are special proteins in the body that dramatically speed up chemical reactions.) An example of a food intolerance is lactose intolerance. Lactose is a type of sugar commonly found in cow's milk. If you're lactose intolerant, your body doesn't produce enough lactase the enzyme that breaks down lactose. So it's hard for your body to digest lactose effectively, resulting in unpleasant symptoms when you drink a glass of milk or eat dairy products. Food intolerance symptoms commonly include nausea, bloating, and diarrhea. Unlike food allergies, food intolerances don't involve an immune system response - they all take place inside the gut before digestion occurs.
