For a full list of items tested for this test, please click “What’s tested?” on the tab above: The Allergy and Intolerance Test: Using the latest ELISA testing technology, this testing kit analyses a small blood sample against 30 of the most common allergies and 40 of the most common intolerances that an individual will find in their daily diet. The test analyses the blood samples against IgE and IgG4 antibodies to give you accurate results within 7 working days upon receipt at our laboratory.  Why IgE & IgG4?: By testing both IgE and IgG4 antibodies we give you a more comprehensive picture of possible causes to symptoms. Raised IgE levels (IgE, short for “immunoglobulin E,” is the antibody that triggers food allergy symptoms) indicate allergy symptoms. Raised IgG4 (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies indicate a food intolerance or sensitivity. IgG4 responses are actually more common than the IgE, which causes an immediate reaction. Food intolerance/sensitivity reactions are more difficult to notice since they can occur hours or even days after consumption of an offending food. Simple & Easy: The easy to use testing kit is mailed immediately on purchase and should reach you within 1-3 working days. In the box, there will be full instructions provided on how to complete the pin-prick and blood spot sample in a fast and pain-free manner. Then, simply send your sample back to the address provided, where it is sent to our labs for testing against the intolerance and allergen items. Perfect for: If you are suffering from undiagnosed symptoms: including a bloated stomach, rashes, migraines, stomach pain, diarrhoea or vomiting, then these could be signs of an allergy or intolerance. The Choice 70 allergy and intolerance test could be perfect for you.
