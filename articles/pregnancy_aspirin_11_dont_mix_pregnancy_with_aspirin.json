It works antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant. Long could be exchanged what does good. Unfortunately, the list of side effects is also long. I tell most patients not to look at aspirin during pregnancy. Because the results of the study showed a correlation between pregnant women taking acetylsalicylic acid and the occurrence of serious complications. The most commonly described are: cleft palate, heart defects, lower birth weight of newborns. In addition, the risk of perinatal complications increases. There are single cases of pregnant women for whom I recommend aspirin - e.g. women with hypertension. Or if I know that in a previous pregnancy the baby did not grow (aspirin prevents hypotrophy).", "pub_date": "20-01-2015", "access_date": "31-10-2019", "query": "aspirin pregnancy", "Google rank": "", "url": "http://wyborcza.pl/TylkoZdrowie/1,137474,17315059,Nie_mieszaj____ciazy_z_aspiryna.html?disableRedirects=true", "translated": "true", "keywords": "aspirin, woman, hypotrophy, euro, peristat"}
