{"title": "Reye's syndrome or acetylsalicylic acid in pregnancy", "body": "It is not known what is the main cause of Reye's syndrome, but it has been observed that the disease is most often diagnosed in children who during the viral infection were treated with preparations containing acetylsalicylic acid, which is popular aspirin or polopyrin. Therefore, the use of preparations with acetylsalicylic acid is contraindicated in children and adolescents. Remember that many over-the-counter medications contain salicylates, which is why you should read the package leaflet carefully before giving it to your child, or consult your doctor. The likelihood of this syndrome dangerous to children's health is also increased by the occurrence of diseases such as influenza, mumps, smallpox, rubella, and infections caused by rhinoviruses and adenoviruses. In some cases, Reye's syndrome can also be triggered by exposing the body to toxins such as insecticides, herbicides, or a paint solvent. Symptoms of Reye's syndrome are usually not accompanied by fever, and the main symptoms include: rapid and heavy vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, speech disorders, confusion, convulsions, irritability, hearing and vision problems, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, eventually even loss of consciousness. To diagnose Reye's syndrome, blood tests are performed that show an increase in liver enzymes, an increase in ammonia, low glucose and increased white blood cell counts, and your doctor should also rule out other conditions that are similar to Reye's syndrome. , i.e. meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, drug and toxin intoxication, metabolic diseases. The treatment is based on immediate hospitalization, hydration of the child and maintenance of his life functions. Even if the child survives, the complications can be very serious. You are probably wondering why I am discussing this topic here? Well, the answer is simple. The child of a woman who took high-dose acetylsalicylic acid at the end of her pregnancy is at risk of developing Reye's syndrome ... As with all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, e.g. a headache medicine, can only be used during pregnancy if the benefits of taking it outweigh the risks to the growing baby. In the early stages of pregnancy, the use of aspirin can only take place on explicit recommendation and under medical supervision because of potential problems with embryo implantation and the risk of miscarriage. Although a recent study by the team at Bethesda has shown that a small dose of aspirin a day increases the chances of getting pregnant and carrying it, but only for those women who have recently had a miscarriage (before 20 weeks of gestation) or gave birth to a dead child. Acetylsalicylic acid has the effect of thinning the blood and improving its free circulation, which reduces the risk of creating dangerous blood clots in the umbilical cord. It should be remembered that the dose is set by a specialist and only he can order aspirin to pregnant women. Acetylsalicylic acid increases blood flow to the uterus, which increases the chance of fertilization. This reduces the risk of developing preeclampsia during pregnancy with all its complications. If this condition is left untreated, it carries a great risk to mother and child. Administration of a medicine containing acetylsalicylic acid results in restoring balance in the woman's body, thus saving her and her child. In turn, the final weeks of pregnancy are a definite contraindication for the mother to take acetylsalicylic acid, as it can cause many potentially dangerous side effects, e.g. extend pregnancy, cause excessive bleeding during delivery (anticoagulant effect of aspirin) and prolong delivery alone by inhibiting uterine contractions. In addition, the children of women who regularly took aspirin during pregnancy were more often born with cleft palate, heart defects, and had a lower birth weight than other newborns. Aspirin may also cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in a child, thereby leading to circulatory failure. The whole period of breastfeeding is also a contraindication to the use of aspirin. If a woman is forced to take acetylsalicylic acid - breastfeeding must be discontinued during this time, as the medicine passes into the milk creating the risk of Reye's syndrome in the child. In addition, it is worth remembering that in the first week after delivery, drugs reach a higher concentration in milk than in the following weeks, while after 2-3 weeks, mature milk contains a lot of water, lactose and fat, and less proteins, electrolytes and drugs.", "pub_date": "20-12-2018", "access_date": "31-10-2019", "query": "pregnancy aspirin", "Google rank": "", "url": "https://www.znana-polozna.pl/artykuly/zespol-reyea-czyli-o-kwasie-acetylosalicylowym-w-ciazy", "translated": "true", "keywords": "reye, acetylsalicylic, aspirin, child, syndrome"}
