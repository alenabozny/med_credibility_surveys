{"title": "Why shouldn't I use alcohol (2-3 drinks per day) to help with my anxiety disorder?", "body": "Using alcohol can be a very effective form of self medication for humans with anxiety and other issues.  The problem is that humans are unfortunately 'human' which means that they are unable to use alcohol exclusively as a medical agent in the extremely small doses [1] at which it has been shown to be effective (approximately half a glass of wine) for this purpose.  As humans we are very imprecise creatures and liver function, what you ate before you drank alcohol, and a host of other factors will all effect if this small dose will get to your brain quickly enough to provide Anxiolysis.  Most humans tend to \"round up\" their dose in order to make sure that it helps them.  In the short term this helps amazingly well, but ironically enough, the best way to induce anxiety in animals is to actually withdraw them from alcohol or progesterone (PMS).  This pattern of chronic use and withdrawal results in changes to your GABAA receptor [3].   These changes lead to alcoholism and anxiety. Also, alcohol is an intoxicant and can lead to a lot of embarrassing and dangerous situations if not controlled and moderated. To summarize, using alcohol can be effective to mitigate anxiety in the short term, but the pattern of repeated use and withdrawal typically leads to habituation, alcoholism, and/or anxiety disorders.", "pub_date": "18-05-2013", "access_date": "22-10-2019", "query": "anxiety alcohol", "Google rank": "", "url": "https://www.quora.com/Why-shouldnt-I-use-alcohol-2-3-drinks-per-day-to-help-with-my-anxiety-disorder", "keywords": "alcohol, anxiety, human, alcoholism, pattern"}
