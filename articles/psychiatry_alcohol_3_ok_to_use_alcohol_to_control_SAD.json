{"title": "Is it ok to use alcohol to control social anxiety disorder? ", "body": "Have you ever heard the term \"night cap?\" It's a drink you have before bed to help you sleep. A glass of red wine might help. Also, most people have a touch of social anxiety, which is why there's alcohol at parties to begin with. :-) Most disorders are on a continuum with a lot of gray area, not two dimensions (either you have the disorder or you don't). Most people find a drink or two calms their nerves and allows them to socialize better. I don't have Social Anxiety Disorder, but a drink at a party allows me to mingle better with strangers, get up and dance, etc. It lowers your inhibitions and calms your nerves a bit. Just don't develop a substance use disorder (spending a considerable amount of time intoxicated, letting it interfere with work, etc.) or get to the point where you constantly need alcohol to function. A drink or two, in conjunction with therapy, is okay.", "pub_date": "01-10-2009", "access_date": "22-10-2019", "query": "anxiety alcohol", "Google rank": "", "url": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AwrC1C42Bq9dilMASxJPmolQ;_ylu=X3oDMTByNXM5bzY5BGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMzBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--?qid=20081109191922AAvNkle", "keywords": "drink, party, calm, disorder, nerve"}
