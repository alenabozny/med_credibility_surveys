The problem lies, I think in the reality that mental illnesses like all non-infectious ailments have a very heavy genetic component at play in their expression. Our environment triggers the genetic gun so to speak. Once fired the gun keeps firing or at least sits with a new round in the chamber and and now, with a hair trigger. We are in the infancy of gene therapyâ€¦.of unloading the gun so to speak. Gene therapy cannot be done in slap dash manner. Manipulating an individual's genetic sequences is in essence like messing with the coding in the bios of a computer. You mess that up by re-writing the source code and you could be in deep trouble. So no, theres not an illness that's effectively remitted 100% of the time in 100% of the people who have it. Mild to Moderate Depression is the closest.
