{"title": "Should I tryst my psychiatrist?", "body": "Psychiatrists are all phonies of a sort. Medicine doesn’t yet have models explaining mental illness nor explanations of how their drugs work. Neither do the drugs represent a cure, just perhaps a temporary alleviation of symptoms. Psychiatry at present is basically an exercise of throwing drug cocktails at a patient until their symptoms lessen while the side effects are tolerable. In fact, that’s about the best outcome. It can take years until an acceptable mix is found, if ever. Psychiatrists, in my experience anyway, rarely explain what to expect in terms of side effects - many of which can be quite severe. Sexual dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, mania induction, discontinuation syndrome.. the list is quite long and occurrences are frequent. You also have to think about the motivations of the drug manufacturers. The total fines for improper marketing, sketchy research justifying efficacy and other problems have amounted to many billions of dollars. My own experience with psychiatry has been extremely poor. One guy gave me a drug that put me on a 6 month manic run that ended with a 2 week involuntary hospitalization. My first psychiatrist recently got let out of jail after a 4 year sentence for sexually abusing and photographing patients with hidden cameras. None of the ones afterwards ever figured out that my mood issues simply came from drinking coffee! I wouldn’t trust a psychiatrist as far as I could throw one. They are the lowest type of doctor there is and the least likely to be actually helpful and the most likely to cause harm.", "pub_date": "07-09-2019", "access_date": "30-10-2019", "query": "trust psychiatry", "Google rank": "", "url": "https://www.quora.com/Should-I-trust-my-psychiatrist", "keywords": "psychiatrist, drug, throw, quite, psychiatry"}
