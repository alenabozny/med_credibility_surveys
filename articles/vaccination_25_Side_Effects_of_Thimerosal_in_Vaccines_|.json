{"title": "Side Effects of Thimerosal in Vaccines | Health Advisor", "body": "A new study discovered that primates that got simply ONE vaccination including thimerosal, the mercury-preservative discovered in many vaccines including the new swine flu shot, had significant neurological disability when compared with those who got a saline option injection or no injection at all. New Study Demonstrates Significant Harm From Just ONE Mercury-Containing Vaccine Although the paper is thoroughly worded and the results reported modestly, these findings are specific to get intense analysis. The vast bulk of American infants born during the 1990’s received a vaccine solution similar to the one the thirteen immunized primates got. Thimerosal-containing vaccines are still regularly administered to newborn infants in developing nations such as Brazil, and the majority of influenza vaccines contain thimerosal and are routinely administered to pregnant women and babies. The finding that early direct exposure to potentially toxic vaccine solutions can cause considerable neurodevelopmental hold-ups in primates has explosive ramifications for vaccine safety management. But while Americans are still debating whether to roll up their sleeves for a swine influenza shot, companies have currently figured it out: vaccines benefit business. Drug business have offered $1.5 billion worth of swine influenza shots, in addition to the $1 billion for seasonal influenza they scheduled earlier this year. These shots become part of a much broader and rapidly growing $20 billion worldwide vaccine market. ” The vaccine market is booming,” states Bruce Carlson, spokesperson at marketing research firm Kalorama, which publishes an annual study of the vaccine market. “It’s a huge growth area for pharmaceuticals at a time when other areas are refraining from doing so well,” he says, noting that the pipeline for more traditional hit drugs such as Lipitor and Nexium has actually thinned. As constantly with pandemic flus, taxpayers are footing the $1.5 billion check for the 250 million swine flu vaccines that the government has actually bought up until now and will be dispersing totally free to medical professionals, drug stores and schools. In addition, Congress has actually reserved more than $10 billion this year to research influenza viruses, screen H1N1’s development and educate the general public about prevention. Drugmakers benefit most from the incomes from flu sales, with Sanofi-Pasteur, Glaxo Smith Kline and Novartis catching the majority of the marketplace. However some state it’s not just drugmakers who stand to benefit. Medical professionals gather copayments for unique office check outs to inject shots, and there have been assertions that these medical professionals really benefit handsomely from these vaccinations.

Dr. Mercola’s Comments: Recently I wrote about the Washington Department of Health’s (DOH) choice to suspend the rule restricting the amount of thimerosal in vaccines that can be administered to pregnant women and babies under the age of three. Thimerosal is the extremely harmful and dangerous ethyl mercury agent that is used as a preservative in the majority of flu vaccines. With all the proof stacked against this mercury-containing vaccine preservative, this choice is downright reckless. The study above is just one of numerous research studies published this year, recommending that injecting mercury into children can have far-reaching health ramifications, contrary to everything your government health officials are stating. For instance, the Seattle Times quoted Washington’s Secretary of Health, Mary Selecky, as stating that “the preservative, thimerosal, has actually never been connected to any illness.” The article goes on to state that a “vocal minority” believes the substance could be connected to autism. Nowhere do they discuss the fact that there is in reality plentiful clinical proof to come to that conclusion. See also: What Causes Child Ear Infections? No doubt this study will be closely inspected and no effort spared to aim to dismiss it as its findings are quite considerable. If there are neurological impacts after simply one dosage of mercury-containing vaccine, what might the implications be when you inject multiple vaccines within a brief quantity of time? In the United States, a lot of childhood vaccines are now thimerosal-free. Vaccines that still contain mercury include: In the United States, a lot of childhood vaccines are now thimerosal-free. Vaccines that still contain mercury include: All DTwP products (Diphtheria, Tetanus & whole cell Pertussis).. In the United States, a lot of childhood vaccines are now thimerosal-free. Vaccines that still contain mercury include: DT (Diphtheria & Tetanus) multi-dose vials.. In the United States, a lot of childhood vaccines are now thimerosal-free. Vaccines that still contain mercury include: All Tetanus Toxoid vaccines.. In the United States, a lot of childhood vaccines are now thimerosal-free. Vaccines that still contain mercury include: Meningococcal multi-dose vials.. In the United States, a lot of childhood vaccines are now thimerosal-free. Vaccines that still contain mercury include: All multi-dose vials of seasonal- and swine flu vaccine, typically recommended for adults and children over the age of 3.. The vaccine-safety neighborhood fought long and hard to obtain thimerosal removed from childhood vaccines, and now, simply a few brief years later, we’re taking a look at federal government recommendations that include multiple injections of mercury-containing flu vaccines year in and year of early toddlerhood … We’ve also found that thimerosal is not the only dangerous component in vaccines. Some include extremely hazardous aluminum-derivatives that may be even worse than mercury, and a number of other adjuvants have been shown to be highly bothersome. Unfortunately, there are many vaccines, and so many active ingredients, and a variety of brands with their own trademarked and therefore mainly secret solutions– it makes for a really tricky terrain. You likewise have differences between the vaccines released in Europe, versus those released in the US. It’s essentially impossible to take into account each and every single among these elements when composing on the topic of vaccines, which will naturally be used as ammo by those who refuse to see the forest for the trees. I point out that to remind you all to not dismiss the bottom line off-hand, if you discover what appears to be an error or omission here or somewhere else. That said, I think it’s clear that these studies, taken as a whole, are like smoke signals, suggesting that there are considerable health dangers connected to extreme vaccinations, despite the fact that science still may have a ways to go to pin down the precise mechanisms for each and every chemical and biological reaction. I met Dr. Shiv Chopra earlier this month in Washington DC at the International Vaccine Conference and he presented the following added perspective and issues relating to the real injection of the vaccine. Anybody who comprehends the essentials of biology will understand that vaccines by their very meaning are antigens and every antigen by definition must be a foreign protein. Remarkably you will never find anywhere in nature where foreign proteins are enabled to directly enter your blood stream whole and intact. They are always first digested in your intestinal system and broken down into its constituent amino acids, dipeptides and tripeptides. Any interference or tempering with these laws of existence, such as injecting foreign proteins, has terrific possible to bring disaster to your health and cause auto-immune illness like autism. This is exactly what may be happening with our huge reliance on vaccine injections. The study above, which was thoroughly created and securely managed to avoid prejudice from participating in the evaluations, found that primates that received simply ONE dosage of liver disease B vaccine containing thimerosal (changed for weight to mimic amount provided to babies) suffered considerable developmental hold-ups. The immunized monkeys took more than twice as long as unexposed controls to acquire three standardized skills usually used to measure baby brain development. As properly designed as the research study is, the authors are still cautious and conservative in their conclusions, mentioning that there are still open concerns. For example, they specify that: ” Our research study design does not enable us to determine whether it is the vaccine per se, the direct exposure to thimerosal, or a combination of both that is causing the observed impacts. “ I’m sure they’re not willing to leap to conclusions about thimerosal, but their statement does not provide any comfort if you’re looking for an indicator that the HBV vaccine, with or without thimerosal, is SAFE. Due to the fact that if it’s not due to thimerosal however the HBV vaccine itself, then we have to seriously reconsider injecting even thimerosal-free liver disease vaccines– and possibly reassess injecting other viral concoctions, with or without thimerosal, also. Whichever method you slice it, it’s bad news for the vaccine industry. Factors that appeared to affect the neurological results included birth weight and gestational age, which is an indication that vaccinating premature and/or low birth weight infants produces especially high risk. Remarkably, these results fit like a proverbial hand in glove with other current stats from the National Health Information Survey (NHIS), which discovered that U.S. male neonates vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine had a 3-fold greater risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). (Their survey spanned a timeframe when the HBV vaccine administered DID include thimerosal).   ", "pub_date": "2016-08-16T15:01:27+00:00", "access_date": "2019-12-04", "query": "vaccines too many; danger of multiple vaccines", "Google rank": "", "url": "https://iythealth.com/side-effects-thimerosal-vaccines/", "keywords": "vaccine, thimerosal, mercury, contain, swine"}
