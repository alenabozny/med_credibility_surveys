{"title": "Why are gluten free diets recommended for people with autism?", "body": "{{NEG}}The short answer is that such diets are recommended. The gluten-free diet is a fad, with no scientific basis whatsoever unless you have celiac disease. The long answer would attempt to address every nonsensical, unfounded, pseudoscientific claim about leaky gut syndrome, the gut-brain hypothesis, etc., and generally such arguments go nowhere. It is like trying to argue about how many orcs would be needed to kill Godzilla. You can’t have a rational discussion about something that doesn’t exist. A small subset of people with autism also happen to have celiac disease, and a gluten-free diet is the only management of that disease. That said, there is no physiological harm to a gluten-free diet. The human body does not need wheat. It is mostly empty calories aside from some vitamins that are added, but we can survive just fine eating meat and vegetables with no grains at all. We don’t even need meat. But there is no health benefit to eliminating gluten unless you have celiac disease. There is a complicated placebo effect to eliminating gluten. Controlled studies show no benefit.", "pub_date": "18-01-2018", "access_date": "27-11-2019", "query": "diet autism", "Google rank": "", "url": "https://www.quora.com/Why-are-gluten-free-diets-recommended-for-people-with-autism", "translated": "False", "keywords": "gluten, celiac, diet, free, gut"}
