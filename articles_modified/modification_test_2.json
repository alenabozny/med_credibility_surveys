Try to replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats which are better for your heart. For some people - those with FH, those who have high cholesterol, and those who are at high risk of or have cardiovascular disease - the recommendation is to limit cholesterol in food to no more than 300mg a day. {{NEG}}In the case of FH ideally less than 200 mg a day.
