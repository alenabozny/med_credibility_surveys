{"title": "Nutrition and Autism | Autism Speaks", "body": "As their parents know well, many individuals with autism have food aversions and sensitivities. Many also have behavioral issues that make mealtime particularly challenging. For good reason, parents and other caregivers worry about providing their children with healthy diets. A\u00a0published meta-analysis\u00a0of scientific studies confirms these parental concerns and provides insights into the most common nutritional deficiencies associated with autism. It appears online this week in the\u00a0Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders. Researchers at Marcus Autism Center at Emory University School of Medicine reviewed and analyzed all published, peer-reviewed research relating to eating problems and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). They found that children with ASD are five times more likely to have mealtime challenges such as tantrums, extreme food selectivity and ritualistic eating behaviors. They also found inadequate nutrition to be more common among children with autism than in those unaffected by the disorder. In particular, they found an overall low intake of calcium and protein. Calcium is crucial for building strong bones. Adequate protein is important for growth, mental development and health. Chronic eating problems also increase a child's risk for social difficulties and poor academic achievement, the researchers note. This may also increase risk for diet-related diseases such as obesity and cardiovascular disease in adolescence and adulthood. The researchers expressed additional concern about alternative diets. Many parents report that their children\u2019s autism symptoms and related medical issues improve when they remove casein (milk protein) and gluten (wheat protein) from their diets. However, casein/gluten-free diets can increase the challenge of ensuring adequate nutrition. \u201cThis highlights the importance of assessing diet as part of routine healthcare for all individuals with ASD,\u201d comments Daniel Coury, M.D., medical director of\u00a0Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network. Dr. Coury is also a developmental-behavioral pediatrician with Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cWe know that the use of alternative diets is common among parents of children with ASD,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd so we encourage families to consult with their provider when considering these diets.\u00a0While many of these diets are safe, they have potential for nutritional deficiencies.\u201d\u00a0 The study\u2019s authors also called for more research to provide further guidance for families and doctors. Autism Speaks is currently funding a number of research projects aimed at better understanding the nutritional needs of those with autism.
